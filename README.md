# Reasong for Choosing Tableau for Visualization
*	Two CSV files, title.csv, and credit.csv, with roughly 10k and 140k records respectively, are part of the Amazon Prime dataset. When working with larger datasets in such situations, Tableau is frequently chosen over Bokeh. Because of Tableau's strong data management features, users can work more effectively and efficiently with massive datasets. Additionally, it provides a large variety of data connectors, making connecting to various data sources simpler.
* To quickly build new visualizations, Tableau provides a selection of pre-built templates, charts, and graphs. Analyzing a dataset and making fast prototypes can be helpful.
* When dealing with massive datasets like Amazon Prime, it is really challenging to identify patterns and trends in the data without a suitable visualization. With Tableau's customization features, we have the power to effectively communicate the most important data points from the data set.
